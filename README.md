# Zvim
simple customization of vim for productivity

vim is awesome but sometimes you just need intellisence and... colors!
so we customized nvim with plugins to make it productive.


The Plugins We Used Are:
1. _tjdevries_ **COC** for code completion
2. _filipdutescu_ **renamer** for helping with renaming something
3. _preservim_ **nerdtree** as the file manager
4. _preservim_ **tagbar** to track the variables and functions you use
5. _nvim-telescope_ **telescope** as a fuzzy finder
6. _vim-airline_ **vim-airline** as the status bar

We Use gruvbox-community's Gruvbox and joshdick's Onedark themes
